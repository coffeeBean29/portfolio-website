        As I was working on the design of this app I wanted to keep in mind the
        goals of the company while trying to provide for the users needs in the
        app. I aimed for a design that would help make peoples lives easier and
        allow scheduling, paying for appointments and contacting doctors. As I
        was working on this project I learned that finding doctors could be an
        annoying task for users and this app would be very helpful but their
        real issues with health had to do with not knowing as much as they would
        like to know about it. Wanting to do more and learn more for themselves
        but not knowing how to start. So as I continued my designs of the app I
        added in some features to help users understand their health better. I
        added a way to explore health and track their health.
