      <h4>Who is Laney?</h4>
      <p>
        I am a complex combination of atoms and molecules that makes me, me. I
        am a daughter, a sister, a wife, and a friend. I am now beginning my
        journey on becoming a UX/UI Designer and am expanding my knowledge in
        front-end development. Being creative came naturally to me when I was
        young. When I was supposed to be in class my Overactive imagination had
        my mind somewhere else, drawing, painting, writing, day dreaming.. That
        seemed to get me in trouble a throughout school, but when I found
        business, marketing and Graphic Design.. I seemed to have found the
        right place for my overactive imagination to possibly thrive and have
        fun.

        My current favorite movie is Spider-man into the Spider-verse. When Iâ€™m
        not watching tv I enjoy paying games on my switch as well as traveling.
        I also really like exercise, specifically running.
